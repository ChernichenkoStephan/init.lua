# German dictionaries for Vim

This is an effort to create a reliable german dictionary for Vim. It
combines he well known *frami* word lists with an affix file compatible
to Vims MySpell / Hunspell dialect.

* The word lists are taken from:
  https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/german-de-de-frami-dictionaries
* The affix files are based upon earlier work found here:
